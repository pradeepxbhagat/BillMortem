BillMortem is a utility which helps the user to do a postmortem on credit card bill. Once the user opens the bill, pdf reader view will display all the transaction and group all the distinct transaction on a pie chart. The user can search either by search bar or by highlighting a word/multiple words as a result user will be presented with sectioned transaction and respective total. Currently, this is supported only for HDFC, CITI and ICICI credit card bill.

Intelligent report uses artificial intelligence to provide a chart which displays grouped transaction even though their model (description or vendor is different). For accessing the functionality user need to select pdf chooser in the Pdf viewer screen.

Caching of parsed transaction is supported for fast retrieval of the transaction. The searching algorithm has been updated to KMP Algorithm.
